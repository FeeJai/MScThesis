I would like to thank the whole team at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's AgeLab and especially Bryan Reimer, PhD for granting me the opportunity to conduct the research that started this thesis. The year in Boston has been phenomenal and one of the best times of my life.

Special thanks goes to Lex Fridman, PhD for mentoring me throughout my time at the AgeLab and for supervising the creation of this thesis. % not possible without his help

Furthermore I would like to thank Dr. Haneberg for supervision as well as Prof. Knapp and Prof. Bauer at the Universit√§t Augsburg for reviewing this thesis and for the confidence in me. It would not have been possible without their support.
